# Ones and Zeroes by Yeona Ellice L. Soleng  
It’s easy to forget sometimes that computers don’t really “see” or “feel” the world the way we do. At the lowest level, everything they process boils down to ones and zeroes, tiny electronic switches flipping on and off. That’s it.

And yet, from those ones and zeroes, entire worlds are born. Those switches form binary numbers, and numbers can represent anything. A single number might represent how far one point is from another, the brightness of a pixel, or the color of a surface. Combine enough of these numbers, and suddenly you’re no longer looking at abstract math. You’re looking at an image, a video, or even a 3D world.

Take 3D software as an example. A model of a character or object isn’t really “a duck” or “a cube.” It’s a list of coordinates called vertices, each one just a set of numbers measured from the origin. Connect the vertices with edges and you get shapes. Connect the shapes into faces and you get a mesh. Already, from pure math, you can outline the structure of an object.

But it doesn’t stop there. To make the object look real, you wrap it in textures, which are 2D images that are stored numbers representing colors. Then shaders, which are basically mathematical instructions, tell the computer how light should bounce off the surface: shiny, matte, transparent, or even glowing. Add lighting data, camera position, and perspective, and suddenly the computer can flatten this 3D scene into a convincing 2D image on your screen.

If the object needs to move, rigging adds another layer of numbers. Virtual “bones” define how different parts of the mesh should rotate and bend. Instead of updating thousands of vertex positions by hand, the computer only needs the coordinates of the bones and the rules of how the mesh follows them. That is how animators breathe life into characters.

Game engines then bring everything together. They place all these number-based models into a scene, apply physics, lighting, and movement rules, and let players explore immersive worlds like Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey or Spider-Man.

So while it may look like magic when Spider-Man swings across New York, at its core it is all math. Just numbers. Ones and zeroes layered with meaning until they become something greater than the sum of their parts.
